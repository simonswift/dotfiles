Dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles for my bash profile, aliases and vim plugins.

If you wish to use this has a starting point, I suggest forking the repo and then amending gitconfig to use your own details.

Also find some of my first installs on a fresh system. Feel free to message me on twitter (@adamgeorgeson) if you have any suggestions.

These files are currently in use on Max OSX 10.10.2.
